We have 2 issues with our in-house ticketing system connecting to AWS<br /><br />
1.	SSL / http issue after whitelisting the IP Addresses. When going to the URL of the site, it show&rsquo;s site is not secure, we need to give the site a valid SSL certificate<br /><br />
2.	After whitelisting the IP Address from AWS in our firewall, we still cannot see the website<br /><br />
The setup we have is a bespoke in-house made software application that runs our ticketing system. Our ticketing system is creating in .NET Core which has an SQL Database with it. This is hosted on premise on our own internal servers.<br /><br />
We have also created 3 customer portals so customers can see their live ticket data, but this is hosted in AWS (cloud). <br /><br />
We have managed to get 2 customer portals to work. Both have SSL certificate issues. The third portal doesn&rsquo;t work &ndash; we are getting a bad gateway error. It seems like we have configured it the same way in AWS and our Firewall (but we are not 100% confident). <br /><br />
The systems / platforms we use are: <br /><br />
&bull;	Windows Server<br />
&bull;	AWS<br />
&bull;	SQL<br />
&bull;	Unifi Firewall<br /><br /><br />
Thank you<br /><br />

After you solve it, it shows a code. I just need to get as many of those codes as possible.<br /><br />
We can refresh the page to restart the process.<br /><br />

we are a microsoft -centric company with Business Central, and Business Premium licensing, so open to sharepoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows environment.<br /><br />
However, for the trial project, it is initially smaller to see how we go.&nbsp;&nbsp;see below:<br /><br />
We want to set up DOXCF autofiler (or similar) to work in with our PRINTERS AND SCANNERS so we can scan hardcopy paper copies of physical documents (signed customer invoices) into a folder, whereby the software will then use OCR to identify an invoice number which is in the same location on each document. the software should then name the file with the document number and file it into another folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;Docfx has been used in the past, successfully, but a similar tool might help us find a document number and name the document. <br />
The project length will be possibly 1 days work for an expert? <br /><br />
The ideal candidate will have experience in document scanning, automation, document management systems, and Microsoft SharePoint Designer?<br /><br />
 The successful candidate will be responsible for setting up and configuring the autofiler or similar tool to meet our specific requirements.<br /><br />
We are looking for a candidate who can submit a proposal outlining their experience with similar projects, as well as their approach to this specific project. Please include links to past completed projects that demonstrate your expertise in this area.<br /><br />
We look forward to hearing from qualified candidates and working together to improve our document management process.<br /><br />
with a possible view to further work<br /><br />
Exact Job Scop<br /><br />
1)	Set up our current printers/scanners to scan our paper invoices (With customers signatures) into a folder on our server (on premises, Windows OS)<br />
2)	Have the software use OCR in a certain location at the top Right position of the page to identify the Invoice Number on each document. <br />
3)	Rename the File Name to the document number<br />
4)	Moved Renamed files into a windows folder called &ldquo;Named Invoices&rdquo;<br />
5)	Any files that it cannot find the number, move the file into a folder called something like &ldquo;Number Unknown&rdquo;<br />
6)	At this stage we aren&rsquo;t using sharepoint, but happy to consider, as long as our Business Central (Dynamics BC19 on prem) will still be able to perform it&rsquo;s script of picking up the files from &lsquo;named invoices&rsquo; and linking them with the corresponding &lsquo;posted invoice document&rsquo; within BC.<br />
7)	Further automations may be run as recommended other projects<br />
Please provide any licensing costs for the software required.&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently already use Microsoft BC and Business Premium.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $500

An additional feature I would need is the ability to choose position sizing as a factor of risk % instead of a flat size. For example if I instruct the program to risk 1% of my portfolio, and my portfolio is currently $100, the program will enter a trade that will lose me $1 if the trade hits stop loss. <br /><br />
The bot source code has a way that I could control different things in the bot by changing the words in the code. I need to be able to control aspects of the bot as well, like the pair it is working on, or the risk% or i can turn the bot on or off) <br /><br />

I have a handwriting robot.  - Upwork]]></title><link>https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Need-someone-with-experience-Adobe-Illustrator-SVG-and-Python-have-handwriting-robot_%7E012473e74e61ae6aa1?source=rss</link><description><![CDATA[Hi, I want to write letters with handwriting. I have a special handwriting machine. <br /><br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7apC4KbVqJk<br /><br />
It accepts SVG files, works with inkscape, <br /><br />
There are a couple of things I want to do with this machine. <br /><br />
One is write handwritten letters.<br />
The paragraph that I am writing will always be the same. It is this:<br /><br />
&amp;quot;I wish to receive Sweeps Coins to participate in the sweepstakes promotions offered by Chumba Casino. By submitting this request, I hereby declare that I have read, understood and agree to be bound by Chumba Casino&#039;s Terms and Conditions and Sweeps Rules.&amp;quot;<br /><br />
The tricky part is, I need it to look really handwritten. So I need a way for each letter to look slightly different. <br /><br />
One way I was thinking about this, was handwriting this card myself 50 times. That would produce 50 uniquely handwritten cards with unique letters. <br /><br />
Then I would scan all 50 cards. <br />
Then either print one of the 50 cards each time, or a better way would be to isolate each letter at each position, then dynamically generate every letter by randomly using a letter from each card.<br /><br />
This would probably require some programming. <br />
The end result would need to be a SVG file that that machine can use. <br />

We seek an experienced developer with expertise in ReactJS and a strong background in building browser extensions for Chrome and Edge.<br /><br />
1. Project Overview:<br /><br />
Our password management browser extension is currently based on the deprecated Manifest V2 architecture. To ensure compatibility with modern browsers and improve security, performance, and functionality, we require the conversion to the latest Manifest V3 specification. It is a large application with multiple background scripts that communicate with a local desktop service for password synchronization. It includes auto-fill capabilities in the content script that needs to keep working flawlessly. It also has a significant and vital Native Messaging component that needs to be maintained as the app is transitioned to the new Manifest version. It is a production application with thousands of deployments. You must have experience in working with large and complex browser extensions and ReactJS to do this project.<br /><br />
2. Project Scope:<br /><br />
The project scope includes the following tasks:<br /><br />
- Convert the existing extension from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3, adhering to the new architecture&#039;s guidelines and limitations.<br />
- Update the extension codebase written in ReactJS, making necessary adjustments to accommodate the new architecture requirements.<br />
- Ensure the extension remains compatible with Chrome, Edge and Firefox browsers, verifying proper functionality and stability.<br />
- Implement any necessary security enhancements or best practices recommended for Manifest V3 extensions.<br />
- Test the converted extension thoroughly, including compatibility testing across different browser versions and platforms.<br />
- Provide documentation outlining the changes made and instructions for maintaining and updating the extension in the future.<br /><br />
3. Proposal Requirements:<br /><br />
Interested freelance developers are requested to submit the following information:<br /><br />
- Personal profile and relevant experience, specifically related to ReactJS development and browser extension development for Chrome and Edge.<br />
- Details of similar projects completed, highlighting successful conversions from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3.<br />
- Proposed timeline for the project, including key milestones and deliverables.<br />
- Proposed approach and methodology for the conversion, emphasizing any unique strategies or techniques.<br />
- Pricing structure, indicating either an hourly rate or a fixed project price.<br />
- References from previous clients who can verify the quality and timeliness of your work.<br /><br />
4. Submission Guidelines:<br /><br />
Please include your ideas on the process for completing the project with clear guidelines as to how you will go about doing the task.<br /><br />
5. Selection Process:<br /><br />
Upon receiving the proposals, our evaluation team will review and assess each submission based on the following criteria:<br /><br />
- Demonstrated expertise and experience in ReactJS development and building browser extensions for Chrome and Edge.<br />
- Successful completion of similar projects, particularly conversions from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3.<br />
- Proposed timeline and methodology for the conversion.<br />
- Competitive pricing and value for the services offered.<br />
- Positive references and feedback from previous clients.<br /><br />
We reserve the right to request additional information or schedule interviews with shortlisted freelance developers, if necessary. The final decision will be communicated to the selected developer in a timely manner.<br /><br />
Successful completion of this project may lead to a longer contract for ongoing maintenance and upgrades of the browser extension.<br /><br />
Thank you for your interest in this project, and we look forward to receiving your proposal.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $15.00-$32.00

The catalog has been previously created in Microsoft Publisher and contains images and text that have been imported using an Excel file. The macro should be able to:<br />
2. Functional Requirements<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Automatic removal of blank rows: After the catalog has been created, the macro should automatically remove all blank rows that have been caused by empty values, including rows that are empty only because of formatting.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Automatic adjustment of image size: The macro should be able to automatically adjust the size of the images in the catalog based on a value specified in the Excel file. For example, if a value of &amp;quot;16mm&amp;quot; is specified in the Excel file, the image should be adjusted to a size of 16mm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Adjustment of the frame containing the text content. This should adapt variably to its content. In some cases, the content may be longer, in which case it should wrap to the next page.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. User-friendliness: The macro should be easy to use. It should have a clear user interface that allows the user to execute the macro with one click.<br />
3. Non-Functional Requirements<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Performance: The macro should work quickly and reliably. It should be able to clean and adjust large catalogs with many images and text within a few minutes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Scalability: The macro should be able to work with different versions of Microsoft Publisher and Excel. It should also be able to work with catalogs that have different formats and layouts.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Maintainability: The macro should be easy to maintain. It should be programmed in such a way that it is easy to update if the requirements change or if errors occur.<br />
4. Appendix<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Sample Data: A sample dataset should be provided to help the developer test the macro. We provide a sample file from the Microsoft Publisher File, as well as a sample set of data in Microsoft Excel.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. User Manual: A user manual should be provided to explain to the user how to use the macro.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Source Code: The source code of the macro should be provided to the customer so that they can modify or extend the macro if needed.<br /><br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $500
